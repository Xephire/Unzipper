# Unzipper

# This branch is experimenting with a new library called pyunpack, which utilises the patoolib library, for decompressing multiple file types (rar, zip, possibly 7z though this doesn't currently work with PyInstaller)

A small Python program which allows users to extract all .zip files in any given folder using the right-click context menu.

Goals: 
  - Compile both scripts into an executable to be installed on a users computer ✔
  - Add support for more file types (e.g. .rar, .7z) ✔
