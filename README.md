# Unzipper

A small Python program which allows users to extract all .zip files in any given folder using the right-click context menu.

Goals: 
  - Compile both scripts into an executable to be installed on a users computer ✔
  - Add support for more file types (e.g. .rar, .7z) ✔
 
Notes:
  - It is best to have 7zip installed on the target system however this is not 100% necessary as I bundled the 7z.exe with the installer.
  - I may try to change how a console window pops up for every extraction task in the future, as I find it quite annoying.
