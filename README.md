# Unzipper

A small Python program which allows users to extract all .zip files in any given folder using the right-click context menu.

Goals: 
  - Compile both scripts into an executable to be installed on a users computer ✔
  - Add support for more file types (e.g. .rar, .7z) ✔
 
I may try to change how a console window pops up for every extraction task in the future, as I find it quite annoying.
